# Summary
In this project, I built a relational database in MySQL using historical stock data from Coca-Cola (KO) between 2019 and 2024. I performed data import, validation (including null checks and outlier detection), and exploratory analysis. The project includes insights on daily price variation, monthly averages, trading volume, and the creation of analytical views using SQL window functions such as RANK, LEAD, and LAG. It serves as a solid foundation for time series analysis, financial insights, and future data visualization.

# Key Insights
1. Here, I developed a monthly analysis of Coca-Cola’s stock prices using SQL, grouping the data by month to calculate the average closing prices and identify the highest price recorded in each period. This approach provides a clear view of trends and monthly variations over time:
